## Popular Variations
If you are wondering why some moves like **Weaver of Fate** are not in this list:
Variations specifically refer to slight changes and adjustments to move.
Weavers are a special category of FGFA plus another move alongside it.
> I'll add a way to sort through specifically Weaver combos later :p

> [!example] Flick God Partial Ascension
> - **F**/ {c/w}1 -> D JJ F1
> \- or -
> - **F**/ {p/b/d}1 -> D JJ F1 B
> 
> If a single component of FGFA is missing, it is a Partial Ascension. 
> The structure being something below a cube in durability counts as a missing component.

> [!example] Hold-to-Flick Pipeline
> - **/**/ {c/w}1 "(s)"2 -> D J M2 B F1
> 
> Substitutes the Flowstone double jump with a hold flight bump.

> [!example] Apotheosis
> - **F**/ {c/w}1 {c/w}2 -> D JJ F1 B F2 B

> This variation is not well documented. I apologize if the notation is incorrect.
> Once further documented, the move will likely get its own page.
> 
> This is an **incredibly** difficult move to land.
> Do note that, from what has been documented, flying on the first structure for more than a second invalidates the move. Hence the lack of an **M** in the notation.

> A few weavers **might** fall under the classification of variation, such as Chaos Weaver.
> So expect this section to change a lot.
