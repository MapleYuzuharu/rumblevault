Let Flick and Hold work in harmony, and arise more who use both.

Inspired by [[Three Cube Special\|Three Cube Special]], this move combines a timed mount (similar to [[Combo/Alley-Oop\|Alley-Oop]]) and throws two forward attacks before flying at the opponent.

This move can be done with either hold OR flick with little lost in setup. Hold can allow bringing a chamber while flick has more lenient timing.

**Timing the 2nd and 3rd cube differently, or adding explode, can create more disruption and use cases.**
