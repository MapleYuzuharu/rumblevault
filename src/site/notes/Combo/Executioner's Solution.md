Allows for controlled flight, and easy flight at that, the held wall manages to reinforce the flick flight of the cube assuming its flat and centered below you.
It's still recommended that you know flick only flight.

**Make sure to pause between the two jumps. Moving too quickly will break your hold on the wall.**
