> [!example] Maple's Vault Notation
> - **FL** / {c/w/o}1 -> TD J**J** F1 B

With flow stone equipped, dash jump, double jump and then flick an incoming structure of cube or above in durability, then bump yourself in any direction before landing the structure on your opponent as you land.

**Those who've hit FGFA often experience severe Ascentia, similar to those removed from the timeline.**
*Practice safety with flick!*

 - Flick God Full Ascension on Client in a lab setting. Performed by DizzyDreaming

## Move Information
**Inventor** : shoeless
**School** : Shoeless Flick
**Style** : [[NotationGuide#**Style** Super-Aerial\|Super-Aerial]]
*Must be hit in a valid match against a black belt to qualify for the title of "Ascended" inside the Shoeless Dojo.*

## Criteria as Described by Shoeless
> [!quote]
> We have a role for those who have ascended. It must be clipped. It must be verified.
> **Here lies the criteria of the Flick God Full Ascension:**
> 1. Catch an opponents incoming cube, wall or boulder when you are at least 80% jump height
> 2. Use a double jump before falling below 80% of jump height
> 3. Use said structure to gain aerial mobility - aerial sling, bump, mount - to immediately guide yourself towards your opponent. No flying around.
> 4. Hit opponent on the fall before or just after you hit the ground having committed to a final flail swing.

## Popular Variations
If you are wondering why some moves like **Weaver of Fate** are not in this list:
Variations specifically refer to slight changes and adjustments to move.
Weavers are a special category separate from FGFA.
> I'll add a way to sort through specifically Weaver combos later :p

> [!example] Flick God Partial Ascension
> - **FL**/ {c/w}1 -> D JJ F1
> \- or -
> - **FL**/ {p/b/d}1 -> D JJ F1 B
> 
> If a single component of FGFA is missing, it is a Partial Ascension. 
> The structure being something below a cube in durability counts as a missing component.

> [!example] Hold-to-Flick Pipeline Ascension : Hold-to-Flick Mobius Shift
> - **/**/ {c/w}1 "(s)"2 -> D J M2 B F1
> <video controls loop autoplay muted>  <source src="https://files.catbox.moe/de2zd4.mp4" type="video/mp4">  Your browser does not support the video tag.  </video>
> - Substitutes the Flowstone double jump with a hold flight bump.
> - Does not count as a full ascension since its a variation.

> [!example] Apotheosis : Tapestry of the Gods
> - **FL**/ {c/w}1 {c/w}2 -> D JJ F1 M F2 B
> 
> This variation may not be well documented. I apologize if the notation is incorrect.
> 
> This is an **incredibly** difficult move to land.
> I *think?* it counts as a full ascension in Shoeless Dojo, not guaranteed though.


> [!example] Mobius Shift
> - **/**/ -> ...


> A few weavers **might** fall under the classification of variation, such as Chaos Weaver.
> So expect this section to change a lot.
