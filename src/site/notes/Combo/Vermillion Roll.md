A mutation of [[WIP/Heartline Roll\|Heartline Roll]]

With a wall, cube launch it before making the cube volatile. From there you can perform a Heartline Roll on the wall as it hits the volatile cube.

**The volatile cube provides enough lift and pushing force for you to adjust how the wall bumps you.**
