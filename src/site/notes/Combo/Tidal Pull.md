With a flicked ball, use modifiers to send it around an incoming or free structure to pull it towards you.

Note how Charge Stone is optional. This move can technically be used without it, though it loses much of it's opportunities due to less range and power.

**If the structure is <u><strong>grounded</strong></u> then it must already be moving. Otherwise, your ball will always break!**
Most structures can be snagged easily if done at the peak of the ball's arc.
