***

When you find an incoming ungrounded attack, you can dash towards your opponent to the right or left of their incoming projectile and flick it. The structure will keep moving but with the resistance of your flick, soon to snap back towards you. Keep your arms wide to prevent it from hitting you on its rebound, straight as it flies by to further that slingshot-like speed.

**Recommended: Learning Flick Flail before this move, as it transitions nicely into it if you miss the initial rebound Return-to-Sender.**
