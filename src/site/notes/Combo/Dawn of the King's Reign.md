Straight a wall to create space with your opponent and time to setup the full setup. Then, use the KB to setup Pogo's Trap and setup Soaring Stars behind the trap. Hold the trap wall and finish the setup for Soaring Stars to complete the move.

**Important to use the knockback from your cover wall. It's not just for protection, it's part of the setup too.**
