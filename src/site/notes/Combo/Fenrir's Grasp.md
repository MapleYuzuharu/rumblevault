 True combo stunlock move, using a previously discovered state in stunlock known as "low pop", where you hit your opponent with 2 structures at the same time, the knockback from both structures cancel out and you can phase your opponent inside your wall cube spam and just MELT them

Fenrir's Grasp has an escape opportunity with flow dash at the beginning, but to make up for it, it then is inescapable afterwards and can hypothetically bring you to 0 health from full.

**Note: Stunlocking is mean.**
