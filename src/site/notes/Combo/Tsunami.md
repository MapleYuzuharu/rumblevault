***

A combination of Springless and Alley-Oop, summon two cubes, flick the bottom while walking back, then Flick the top as it falls below you, using the downward momentum of the cube to bring it around yourself.

**Using flow dash to change direction is rewarding but requires awareness of your flicked structures.**
