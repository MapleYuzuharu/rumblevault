> [!quote] Message of the Day
> Now seeking clips for moves!
> Please send mp4/mkv videos to me in DMs on Discord or in my bender-bio channel in Shoeless Dojo.
> You can use [Litterbox](<https://litterbox.catbox.moe/>) if you don't have nitro to send bigger files.
> YouTube works too!
> **Criteria for Clips**
> - Clean and easily readable what is happening.
> - No music or absurdly loud sounds.
> - Preferably no exotic structure skins or other weird mods.
> - Lab environment clips are actually encouraged! They often have more clarity.
> - Overly optimized poses can sometimes make them difficult to learn from.
> To sum it up, I'm looking for clips that can clearly convey what a move is to anyone seeking to learn it.

> `ismynameunique` on Discord
> Search Maple Tree in the `#bender-bios` in Shoeless Dojo otherwise.
> Note that I make pages when I find time, so don't be disappointed if you send me clips and I don't do anything with them for like a month =w=
