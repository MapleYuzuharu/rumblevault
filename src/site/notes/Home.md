# **Maple's RUMBLE Vault**
The goal to document all of RUMBLE's tech and combos into one place.
The ultimate study guide for players wanting to learn new moves.

My notation is slightly different.
// means no shifstones needed.
**Bold** is for when a shiftstone is used.
Amongst some other differences, refer to this notation guide if you get confused.

> [!quote] Message of the Day
> Now seeking clips for moves!
> Please send mp4/mkv videos to me in DMs on Discord or in my bender-bio channel in Shoeless Dojo.
> You can use [Litterbox](<https://litterbox.catbox.moe/>) if you don't have nitro to send bigger files.
> YouTube works too!
> **Criteria for Clips**
> - Clean and easily readable what is happening.
> - No music or absurdly loud sounds.
> - Preferably no exotic structure skins or other weird mods.
> - Lab environment clips are actually encouraged! They often have more clarity.
> - Overly optimized poses can sometimes make them difficult to learn from.
> - CANNOT BE MEDAL, INSIGHT, OR ANY OTHER CLIPPING SOFTWARE LINK, LOOK FOR THEIR SAVE FOLDER
> 
> To sum it up, I'm looking for clips that can clearly convey what a move is to anyone seeking to learn it.

> `ismynameunique` on Discord
> Search Maple Tree in the `#bender-bios` in Shoeless Dojo otherwise.
> Note that I make pages when I find time, so don't be disappointed if you send me clips and I don't do anything with them for like a month =w=



List view will be a gallery with filters eventually. For now just work with me while Obsidian finishes support for Bases in publishing.
